1. Click on any cell to toggle its state and the state of adjacent cells
2. The goal is to turn off all the lights in as few moves as possible
3. A cell can be either lit (yellow) or unlit (gray)
4. Clicking a cell toggles the state of that cell and all orthogonally adjacent cells
5. The game is won when all cells are turned off
